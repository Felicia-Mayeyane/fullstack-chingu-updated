## Optimizations


I had intially used opted to use MongoDB however I had to change it as I came to the conclusion that this kind of database was not appropriate for this project. Because of the data the website collects MongoDB was not the best choice. The website had to be simple and the data had to be readily available not just for collection but for analysis, I found that using SQL would be more beneficial even to the data analysis team as most data analysis in smaller organizations are familiar with relational databases and can easily use it even for quick data visualization. This was a win-win. I am also still working on making the website secure but implementing data sanitization using variables like (filter_var) this is on my priority list for protecting the data coming from the website and protecting the site from being injected with malware.

## Lessons Learned:

I took some time away from the project because for the life of me I could not get my backend working, something was always wrong with myphpadmin. simple things sucb as data not showing up in the database and the form not being responsive. I had underestimated how complicated the backend was. however there was light at the end of the tunnel,  I worked on my routing and ensuring I was inserting the correct data to the appropriate database, ofcourse I am writing about this like it was easy peazy lemon squeazy but it was frustratinng! really frustrating! learned some much more about the backend through struggling with this project. In conclusion, backend.is.not.easy.peazy.
